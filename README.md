## Testing and Launching

Ubuntu 20.04 "Focal Fossa" is recommended. ROS Noetic should be installed.

The following Python packages are required:

- Rospy
- Scikit learn
- OpenCV

### Launch configurations

There are two primary launch files used for testing and running the ACTor vehicles: `v2x.launch` and `follow_lane_one_car.launch`. These are the arguments available to change (those in **bold** *must* be set manually):

`follow_lane_one_car.launch`:
- `vehicle_namespace` (default: "robot1"): "robot1", "actor1", "actor2": This is the vehicle being run (the first option is to run Gazelle Sim).
- `preprocessor` (default: "easy_birdseye"): "easy_birdseye", "full", "passthrough", "crop_only": The initial image preprocessor.
- `lane_detector` (default: "dbscan"): "dbscan", "kmeans", "birdsdbs", "birdseye", "deeplsd", "kmeans", "largest_contour": The lane detection algorithm. **Note:** the "birds-" family of lane detectors *requires* the "passthrough" preprocessor.
- `lane_name` (default: "northbound"): "northbound", "eastbound": the H lot lane the car is driving in. The inner lane is northbound.

`v2x.launch`:
- `vehicle_namespace` (default: "sim"): "sim", "actor1", "actor2": This is the vehicle being run (the first option is to run Gazelle Sim).
- `preprocessor` (default: "easy_birdseye"): "easy_birdseye", "full", "passthrough", "crop_only": The initial image preprocessor.
- `lane_detector` (default: "kmeans"): "dbscan", "kmeans", "birdsdbs", "birdseye", "deeplsd", "kmeans", "largest_contour": The lane detection algorithm. **Note:** the "birds-" family of lane detectors *require* the "passthrough" preprocessor.
- `lane_name` (default: "northbound"): "northbound", "eastbound": the H lot lane the car is driving in. The inner lane is northbound.
- `redlight_behavior` (default: "adaptive"): "adaptive", "stop": What the car should do with regards to intersection states and redlights.
- `measure_comfort` (default: "false"): "false", "true": whether to collect comfort data. **Note:**: this only works in the actual ACTor vehicles.
